~[Booklet downloadable @[here>filePath/org_proc/Architecting_Worlds.pdf]]

In a late 22nd century edition of "Architecting Worlds: A Simple Guide For Simple People", Stolmir et al.'s research in the proceduralization of organic synthesis was compiled into a short, 14 page synth-booklet. The manual was an attempt to raise interest in universal architecture in the general population, as well as to solidify the basic principles of organic pattern production.

It only sold half a million copies. Coincidentally, the information had not been fully experimented with, and as a result, a 17 year old teenager, and avid reader of science articles, inadvertedly created and destroyed 2 universes in a matter of microseconds, causing one of the most catastrophic events in human history.

The booklet was a hit thereafter.
